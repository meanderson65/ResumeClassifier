technicians and other great minds Configured twisted and labeled wires for the Tesla Solar Megapack wire harness using electrical schematics tape electrical tape and basic measuring tools to accurately bundle wires of different gauges and colors together Used computers downloaded firmware and ran electrical test equipment to ensure products are of passing grade Collected data and updated written and electronic records Used measuring tools such as micrometer depth gauges and calipers to take measurements of the drive unit and determine which specific part a drive unit required replacing Used pneumatic grippers manual grippers needlenose pliers rubber hammers mallets and transmission fluid all to not only construct the gearboxes but ultimately seal them together using a hot glue gun Used chisels to shave down busbars after using a pneumatic mechanical press to press and puncture busbars when assisting the line After the copper on the ends of the busbars is smoothed out they are covered with an insulated rubber wrap Typically busbars are passed or failed at each station but a final conductivity test would be run on these busbars before ultimately being passed or failed Used pneumatic cutters and a variety of snips and pliers Loctite aluminum foil tape a heat gun and sandpaper to assist the stator line An endofline stator test would also be run using a doubleended magnet copperended clamps and a single wire connection Determined source of failure in electromechanical builds Can troubleshoot efficiently and determine solutions for battery packs by running pack EOL and examining builds Disassembling Model battery packs beginning by taking out the fuse Batteries are first tested using an EOL and leak test and RCA is updated Using a crowbar cordless metal shears a variety of drill bits tappet wrenches mallets picks blades and a corded air hammer to open disassemble label and clean the pack Repaired hydraulic rotor press Printed stickers for intermediate and differential gears Scanned stickers into an LP using a scanner and the MES system to send units to various locations Ensured that quality and production is maximized consistently by making innovative suggestions that could prevent disastrous outcomes or benefit the comfort of workers quality of work safety or efficiency of assembly lines by discussing with peers and figures of

presses and a multitude of Fanuc robots I am good with computers and the MES system I use the flux system regularly a computerized maintenance management system Faults should be recorded to ensure optimal efficiency and diminish downtime on the production line When assisting the inverter line bolts are torqued marked and different points are inspected to ensure sufficient quality and to prevent

Viewer and Microsoft Excel Amazon SMF Stockton CA Fulfillment Center Associate Oct Dec Fluid Load Outgoing Stacked boxes and totes in a truck repeatedly With these boxes tight walls are constructed to prevent the damage of items or worse the fatality of an employee The truck is filled as more boxes come down the conveyor line and the truck is ultimately sealed off If lines were getting backed up and the conveyors light had gone off I would swiftly alert the associates running the backedup line because being quick to take action is the most effective way to prevent further delay in the process If assistance on the backedup line is required this is when I would jump into the truck and help clear the line out Scanned packages to different locations as they came down the conveyor belt After placing the boxes going to one certain location together I would take the bunch wrap it in plastic and move it to another location in the warehouse using a pallet jack Placed packages onto conveyor belts San Joaquin County Registrar of Voters Stockton CA Election Technician Aug Sep Detail work inspecting ballots submitted by voters from all over San Joaquin County voting in their state governor of choice Ballots with any pencil crayon or other form of stickiness could damage the ballot scanner To prevent this from occurring I would review ballots individually before segregating them into separate piles If a ballot were to have any type of marking on the barcode were too damaged or the voter had written down some bits of personal information on their ballot such as their name the ballots would need to be segregated from the others to ensure that the scanner would be able to read the ballots effectively After ensuring a stack of ballots weighs the correct amount ballots are neatly and precisely pressed whilst making sure the ballots are all facing the same way before using a manual presser and taking the pressed stack and placing it into boxes I also trained other staff members to perform work duties Additional Information classes away from graduating from San Joaquin Delta College currently pursuing a bachelors in electrical engineering I have an understanding of Ohms law I can test voltage alternating currents direct currents and for continuity using a multimeter I have also assisted in cutting and installing countertops and windowsills in peoples homes using

Poster Presentation at Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program Research Symposium poster attached to past experience section Abstract NonAlcoholic Fatty Liver Disease NAFLD is a prevalent form of liver disease that involves accumulation of fat steatosis in the liver among patients with metabolic disease such as obesity and diabetes Although the disease is largely asymptomatic it can progress to end stage liver disease First line treatment is diet and physical activity changes to achieve weight loss The aim of this study was to assess the uptake efficacy and sustainability of a mobile technology lifestyle program for patients with NAFLD Adult patients with NAFLD but without complications of cirrhosis were eligible At enrollment comorbidities labs weight liver imaging via Fibroscan an ultrasound that can assess liver scarring and amount of steatosis and physical function were obtained and repeated in months Patients received a FitBit and individualized step count goals weekly Overall of eligible patients enrolled with primary reason for not enrolling being time constraint patients were enrolled Median age was with males with cirrhosis and with diabetes The median was with having nominimal scarring and the majority having moderatesevere steatosis month step count data showed an increase in mean weekly step count from to Analysis of the patients who completed the program thus far showed an improvement in liver enzymes triglycerides hepatic fibrosis and steatosis scores and physical function These pilot study results highlight the promising role for a mobile technology based lifestyle to improve liver metabolic and physical function outcomes for patients with NAFLD Team Members Kimberly RamirezMontero BSN RN Kimberly RamirezMontero BSN RN MI Heart Safe Project at
